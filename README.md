This repository is the M05 Programming Testing Assignment.


About this repo:
This repository is the M05 Programming Testing Assignment.  The assignment derived from a tutorial on the Real Python website.  The basis of the tutorial was to learn about how to WRITE, EXECUTE and TEST code that I write.  The tutorial taught me how to create parent/child folders, and view the tree, all within Powershell, which I then was able to open in VS Code.  In VS Code, I was able to write scripts, which ultimately I could test directly in WIndows Powershell.  Those files and the screenshots showing the results are all in this repo.

Bug Report: The tests did run and/or fail, as they were supposed to, per the tutorial.  The only issue that I ran into was translating the file/tree creating within Powershell.  This was only because the tutorial was targeted to Linux & Mac users.  However, I was able to create new files using the mddir prompt.  By backing out of each file with cd .., I was able to create a new file.  While inside of a file, I was able to create a new file by using, "New-item" and "copy".  At this point, there are no issues to report.  It was a great tutorial that I highly recommend to all programmers. ~T. Barlow (SDEV 220 Student) | Instructor: C. Francis
